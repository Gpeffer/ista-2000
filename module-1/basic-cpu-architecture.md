Remember

Fill in the blanks:

	1. Central Processing Unit
	2. Floating Point Unit
	3. Memory Management Unit
	4. Arithmetic Logic Unit
	5. 32
	6. 64
	7. 65536
	8. How many bits CPUs could process at a time

Understand

	1. I would rather have 2x faster CPU cache memory because this would directly result in faster performance in the computer, which would also result in faster operations when fetching from the main memory.

	2. Elevator panel, PlayStation 1, Cellphone

	3. The main way CPU manufacturers have increased CPU speed since ~2009 by doing research and developing micro-CPUs, reducing the space needed for efficient computing and allowing for more bits this way.
