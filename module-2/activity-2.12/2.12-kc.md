Understand

Provide short answers to the following questions:

	1. No, "df" shows you the amount of free space on disk drives, and "free" shows you the amount of free memory.

	2. I would say that at first glance, a traditional OS filesystem like Windows is more user-friendly and allows for quicker understanding and ease of use, whereas with Linux, it requires a greater understanding of the way it works in order to use it effectively, but in the long run enables you to do more, more efficiently.

	3. /etc- defines all the system's user accounts
	   /usr contains all the programs and support files used by regular users
	   /home- each user is given a directory in /home. Ordinary users can only write files in their home directories
	   /root- home directory for the root account
	   /tmp- intended for the storage of temporary, transient files created by various programs
	   /proc- virtual file system maintainted by the Linux kernel
	   /sys- server specific and service related files

	4. A hard link relates to file itself, with there not being any real difference between the two, whereas a soft link can be named anything and still relate to whatever file it is linked to.

	5. The passwords for users' accounts are stored in /etc/passwd. Other files that might be useful in this context are passwords for other programs, or perhaps your private key for Github.
