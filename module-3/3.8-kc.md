Understand

Provide short answers to the following questions:

	1. Route table
	2. Physical layer- This is the actual electric current being passed that is causing the signal to be sent; Data layer- Determines the form the signal will be sent in; Network layer- This determines the actual path the data will take; Transport layer- Data is transmitted at this level; Session layer- Maintaining connections; Presentation layer- This is how the data actually looks and presents itself; Application layer- This is where we are able to access and manipulate the data as we see fit
	3. Dynamically-assigned IP addresses are more efficient on a network that will have more unique users. The more unique users, the more efficient dynamically-assigned IP addresses will be compared to statically-assigned. Statically-assigned IP addresses may be okay in a network will there will only be a handful of consistent users, or if certain permissions are needed that will be associated with their specific IP addresses.
	4. Subnets were designed for the problem of having one large, disorganized network consisting of a plethora of different departments. Subnets take this network and divide it into organized sections that can be assigned to specific sections for use. This also assists in increasing efficiency for each user as they won't be trying to use the same bit of the IP for network access.
